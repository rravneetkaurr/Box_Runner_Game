# BoxRunner-Game
This computer graphics project is a 3D endless runner game implemented using OpenGL and GLUT in C++. The game places a player on a linear or slightly varied path suspended in space. The player's goal is to move forward while avoiding dynamic obstacles like spinning red cubes.

Educational Value: 
Demonstrates core OpenGL programming concepts: 3D rendering, transformations and lighting materials. Great for learning real-time rendering and animation logic.

Gameplay Elements: 
Simple yet engaging mechanics similar to "Temple Run" or "Subway Surfers". Allows testing of user inputs, rendering speed and basic physics (jumping, rotation).

Graphics Features: 
Can be extended with shaders, texture mapping or improved lighting models.

Modularity: 
Uses structured functions and a game class (game.updateGame, game.keyW, etc.), allowing further extension.
